<h3 id="1.0">1.0 Project Description.</h3>

<p>While it is possible to maintain the Calc libraries using the Calc macro
organizer, this requires editing the libary macros within Calc, then saving
the changes by exporting the library. This has the disadvantage of jeopardizing
the code in the running library with inadvertant mistakes when modifying code.</p>

<p>The LibBuild project is common to all Calc libraries and keeps the source code
for each library with its Libraries-Project folders. It organizes the
library source code into folders for maintenance operations and provides the
tools to edit individual macros and rebuild the library from source code after
the maintenance operations are complete.</p>

<p>The source code folders are /src/Basic, ../Module1, ../Module2, and Dialogs
under the BadAss parent folder. The maintenance tools are in the
src/Projects-Geany folder. The EditBas project manages the extraction of
source code for editing and maintenance. The LibBuild project manages the build
of the library module(s) from the source code. The source code for the library
is exported by Calc into the files Module1.xba, Module2.xba and &lt; dialog > in
the BadAss folder.</p>

<p>The maintenance operations only apply to the macros portion of the library. The
dialog portion of the library is maintained directly within Calc with the library
loaded. The Basic macros that support the dialog portion are contained
within their own Module2.xba module. The dialog support macros are also handled by the
LibBuild project.</p>

<p>To avoid muddling the Module1.xba, or Module2.xba runtime library code resident
in the parent folder BadAss, the EditBas project stages a copy of
the .xba file into the folder src/Basic/Import. When editing and/or maintenance
of the library macros is complete, the LibBuild project places the new .xba file
in the folder src/Release folder.

<h3 id="2.0">2.0 Library Disassembly.</h3>

<p>The GenFolders shell is run first to create all the required folders within
BadAss for extraction, disassembly, editing and releasing code for the BadAss
macro library.</p>

<p>To perform maintenance or editing of the BadAss library the source code is
first cloned into the /Import folder. That code is again copied into the
/Basic/Modulex folder in its original .xba format. Within the /Basic/Modulex
folder the .xba code is extracted into separate .bas files for each macro code
section within the .xba file. See
the <a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_3fac4a47f4dfeaba4a2d4047746d89ee1a8b215c_termina_penguin/Accounting/BadAss/src/Projects-Geany/EditBas/README.html">EditBas project</a> documentation.</p>

<p>The individual .bas files are edited in place within the /Basic/Modulex folder.
Once complete, the .bas files are combined into a new Modulex.xba file in the
folder /Basic/Release. This folder may be accessed by Calc to load the new
"release" version of the library for testing.</p>

<p>The EditBas project starts by cloning and disassembling the library into 
module folders and .bas macro source files. Library disassembly is a two-step
process. The first step is copying the Modulelx.xba code from the runtime
library. The second step is performed by the EditBas project.</p>

<p>LibBuild creates separate folders for each .xba module within the libary, and
initializes them with the .xba block list for that module. The second step is
performed within the EditBas project which splits the .xba module into separate
.bas source files using the .xba block list created by LibBuild.</p>

<p>The *GenFolders.sh shell scans the Libraries-Project/&lt; libname > repository,
finding all files with an .xba filename extension. For each .xba file found, a
copy is made in the /Import folder. From these .xba files GenFolders creates a
Basic/&lt; xbafile > folder under the &lt; libname > repository main folder. Within
each &lt; xbafile > folder it also creates a file named &lt; xbafile >Bas.txt which
is a listing of all .bas blocks found within the .xba module.</p>

<p>Once this file structure has been established, the library is now ready for
maintenance and modification. All maintenance and modification of the library
source is performed by the EditBas project. See the <a href="file:///media/fuse/crostini_3fac4a47f4dfeaba4a2d4047746d89ee1a8b215c_termina_penguin/Accounting/BadAss/src/Projects-Geany/EditBas/README.html">EditBas</a> project documentation
