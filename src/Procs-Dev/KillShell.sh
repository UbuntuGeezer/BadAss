# Notes. This shell is an alternative way of preventing a shell from executing
# when it has gone out-of-date (usually because of referenced paths changing).
# It became necessary for dealing with shells resident on a Windows-owned drive
# since even *sudo cannot use *chmod to change the 'x' flag (executable).
